## Adam Steger's coding portfolio.
In Java directory, you will find code for the design patterns, as well as UrTern, the internship console application.  
  
In C++ directory, you will find code for algorithms from Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as Advanced Programming Techniques (CSCE 240).  
  
In JavaScript directory, you will find coursework for Computing in the Modern World (CSCE 190), along with HTML and CSS code.  This course surrounded a theoretical design of an app called Therma-Check, an app that monitors temperatures of food, pets, and medicines in vehicles and notifies drivers if they reach unsafe temperatures while they are away from their vehicle.

In computation directory, you will find coursework for Foundations of Computation (CSCE 355).  This course studied abstract models of computation, such as finite automata, grammars, and Turing machines.  This coursework features an epsilon-NFA to NFA converter, as well as an NFA simulator that reads in a string and determines if it is accepted by the given NFA. 

In LifesABit directory, you will find code for my final Capstone Project at the University of South Carolina.  This features a web application called Gate Guard, which is a token-based authentication pass manager for gated communities and businesses.  It has an in-depth description of the user stories, requirements, and architecture in the wiki page, and most of my code can be find in the backend.
